# Rico
Rico is a small chatbot app that is developed for the Seminar "Chatbots and conversational agents" in Fribourg.

## Word of advice
This application did not run (yet) on another computer than my own. So installation may be cumbersome as some requirements are missing or are not specified.

## Scripts
Please be aware that the paths of the scripts are hard-wired to '''/home/pascal/Documents/'''. If you want to use them, you have to adjust them.

retrain.sh: Train rasa-core and rasa-nlu with the current data in rasa
