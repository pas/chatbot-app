# Rico
Rico is a small chatbot app that is developed for the Seminar "Chatbots and conversational agents" in Fribourg.

## Word of advice
This application did not run (yet) on another computer than my own. So installation may be cumbersome as some requirements are missing or are not specified.

## Scripts
Please be aware that the paths of the scripts are hard-wired to '''/home/pascal/Documents/'''. If you want to use them, you have to adjust them.

retrain.sh: Train rasa-core and rasa-nlu with the current data in rasa

## TODO App
* Fully test the application
* Rename components
* Upload to github

## TODO Text
* Write pattern down and name them
* Create pictures for each implemented pattern
* Show patterns on the application

## Enrichment
* Use lists instead of single slots to capture the food
* Use docker containers / Upload to dockerhub
* Separate rasa action server, rasa nlu and rasa core
