# Rico

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## Working

* Chating with the bot in the chat application

## Not working yet:
* Edit in overview
* Update of overview
* Update of the tracker of the chatbot when a change happens

## IMPORTANT
There is problem with the node module "node-rake" because it is the stop words from a file. This is not possible in the browser. You have to change the file app.js to

    const Rake = require('./index.js');
    const path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      generate(content, opts = {}) {
        const fileData = ["a","able","about","above","according","accordingly","across","actually","after","afterwards","again","against","ain't","all","allow","allows","almost","alone","along","already","also","although","always","am","among","amongst","an","and","another","any","anybody","anyhow","anyone","anything","anyway","anyways","anywhere","apart","appear","appreciate","appropriate","are","aren't","around","as","aside","ask","asking","associated","at","available","away","awfully","b","be","became","because","become","becomes","becoming","been","before","beforehand","behind","being","believe","below","beside","besides","best","better","between","beyond","both","brief","but","by","c","c'mon","c's","came","can","can't","cannot","cant","cause","causes","certain","certainly","changes","clearly","co","com","come","comes","concerning","consequently","consider","considering","contain","containing","contains","corresponding","could","couldn't","course","currently","d","definitely","described","despite","did","didn't","different","do","does","doesn't","doing","don't","done","down","downwards","during","e","each","edu","eg","eight","either","else","elsewhere","enough","entirely","especially","et","etc","even","ever","every","everybody","everyone","everything","everywhere","ex","exactly","example","except","f","far","few","fifth","first","five","followed","following","follows","for","former","formerly","forth","four","from","further","furthermore","g","get","gets","getting","given","gives","go","goes","going","gone","got","gotten","greetings","h","had","hadn't","happens","hardly","has","hasn't","have","haven't","having","he","he's","hello","help","hence","her","here","here's","hereafter","hereby","herein","hereupon","hers","herself","hi","him","himself","his","hither","hopefully","how","howbeit","however","i","i'd","i'll","i'm","i've","ie","if","ignored","immediate","in","inasmuch","inc","indeed","indicate","indicated","indicates","inner","insofar","instead","into","inward","is","isn't","it","it'd","it'll","it's","its","itself","j","just","k","keep","keeps","kept","know","knows","known","l","last","lately","later","latter","latterly","least","less","lest","let","let's","like","liked","likely","little","look","looking","looks","ltd","m","mainly","many","may","maybe","me","mean","meanwhile","merely","might","more","moreover","most","mostly","much","must","my","myself","n","name","namely","nd","near","nearly","necessary","need","needs","neither","never","nevertheless","new","next","nine","no","nobody","non","none","noone","nor","normally","not","nothing","novel","now","nowhere","o","obviously","of","off","often","oh","ok","okay","old","on","once","one","ones","only","onto","or","other","others","otherwise","ought","our","ours","ourselves","out","outside","over","overall","own","p","particular","particularly","per","perhaps","placed","please","plus","possible","presumably","probably","provides","q","que","quite","qv","r","rather","rd","re","really","reasonably","regarding","regardless","regards","relatively","respectively","right","s","said","same","saw","say","saying","says","second","secondly","see","seeing","seem","seemed","seeming","seems","seen","self","selves","sensible","sent","serious","seriously","seven","several","shall","she","should","shouldn't","since","six","so","some","somebody","somehow","someone","something","sometime","sometimes","somewhat","somewhere","soon","sorry","specified","specify","specifying","still","sub","such","sup","sure","t","t's","take","taken","tell","tends","th","than","thank","thanks","thanx","that","that's","thats","the","their","theirs","them","themselves","then","thence","there","there's","thereafter","thereby","therefore","therein","theres","thereupon","these","they","they'd","they'll","they're","they've","think","third","this","thorough","thoroughly","those","though","three","through","throughout","thru","thus","to","together","too","took","toward","towards","tried","tries","truly","try","trying","twice","two","u","un","under","unfortunately","unless","unlikely","until","unto","up","upon","us","use","used","useful","uses","using","usually","uucp","v","value","various","very","via","viz","vs","w","want","wants","was","wasn't","way","we","we'd","we'll","we're","we've","welcome","well","went","were","weren't","what","what's","whatever","when","whence","whenever","where","where's","whereafter","whereas","whereby","wherein","whereupon","wherever","whether","which","while","whither","who","who's","whoever","whole","whom","whose","why","will","willing","wish","with","within","without","won't","wonder","would","would","wouldn't","x","y","yes","yet","you","you'd","you'll","you're","you've","your","yours","yourself","yourselves","z","zero"];

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
